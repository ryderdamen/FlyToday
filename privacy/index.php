	  <h1>Fly Today - Privacy Policy</h1>
	  Here's our super simple privacy policy.
	  
	  <h2>What information do you collect?</h2>
	  <p>Automatically, we collect HTTP logs, data transmitted by Actions, and usage information, but no personal identification stuff.</p>
	  
	  <h2>How do you use the information?</h2>
	  <p>We pretty much don’t. We’ll probably check in once in a while to see how many people are using the service, but other than that, nope.</p>
	  
	  <h2>What information do you share?</h2>
	  <p>Nothing. Once again, it’s not that exciting, so we’ve not no plans to share any of this data any time soon.</p>

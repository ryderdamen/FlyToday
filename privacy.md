## What information do you collect?
Automatically, we collect HTTP logs, data transmitted by Actions, and usage information, but no  personal identification stuff.
	  
## How do you use the information?
We pretty much don’t. We’ll probably check in once in a while to see how many people are using the service, but other than that, nope.
	  
## What information do you share?
Nothing. Once again, it’s not that exciting, so we’ve not no plans to share any of this data any time soon.
